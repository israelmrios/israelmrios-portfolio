# Israel Rios' GitHub Portfolio

![I am GitHub Readme Generator's creator](./assets/img/self-image-banner.png)

Software Engineer with a Certificate in Full-Stack Development and a Bachelor's Degree in Information Management. Recent experience in JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, React.js, and responsive web design. Also have experience and knowledge in business administration & information systems. Detail oriented and hard working teammates focused on completing projects on time and above expectation. Applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project where I collaborated in a team of four to develop a single-page app that helps users find movies on different streaming services and provides a description of that movie. I am looking forward to making a difference utilizing my skill sets and experience in a full application lifecycle.
